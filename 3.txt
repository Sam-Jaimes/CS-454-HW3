9.14 Would the lazy algorithm still work if we marked a node as removed simply but setting its next field to null? 
why or why not? what about the lock-free algorithm?

No b/c the remove could be happening in the middle of the list,
the lazy algorithm require you mark the node and then set the predecessor.next = markednode.next
if it happened to be the last item in the list it would work because the markednode.next would be null anyway.

for the lock-free algorithm it would work 
becuase it calls the window() method which returns 
unmarked nodes on each side of the key and gets rid of the
marked nodes so if we mark and set the next fiel to null it would
return the next node not marked.

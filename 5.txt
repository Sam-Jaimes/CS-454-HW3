12.7 Prove that the Tree[2k] balancing network constructed
in section 12.6 is a counting network, that is, that in any quiescent state, the sequences
of tokens on its output wires have the step property

a counting network is a counter that delivers a quiesciently consistent set of indices with high throughput,
a balancer is quiescent if every token that arrives on input wire has emerged on an output wire.
and a balancing network is constructed by connecting some balancers output wires to other balancers input wires

tree[2k] is derrived inductively from a binary tree, when k is equal to 1 tree[2k] consists of a single balancer with out wires y0 and y1
and for k>1 construct tree[2k] from two tree[k] trees and one additional balancer.

assume tree[2k] has a step property in a quiescent state,
tree[k] has the step property in a quiescent state by the book, because
tree[2k] is derived from two tree[k] trees and one additional balancer
then tree[2k+1] is derived from 2 tree[k] trees and one additional balancer aswell
then by induction tree[2k] has a step property in a quiescent state
